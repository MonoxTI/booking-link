            The barrier encountered in learning is often not a lack of "logic," but a psychological block. 
            Our aim commences with addressing the Cognitive, Affective, and Metacognitive layers of learning.
            Simply, <strong>Psychological Transformation</strong> is a technique we use to psychologically infiltrate & remove 
            the thought(s) that certain subjects are unattainable (e.g., "Mathematics is hard"). Once the learner’s psychological 
            thoughts are realigned, constant engagement with the work is required.

            Mathematics requires memory — the ability to hold multiple pieces of information (like a formula, a carry-over digit, 
            and a negative sign) all at once. Thus, for better interaction, we offer monthly subscription. We have noted in the past 
            that the more interaction with the work, the easier it is for their minds to absorb fundamental underlying principles.

            We use <strong>cognitive offloading</strong> to ‘offload’ the mental agony into intermediate steps that are constantly practiced, 
            and free up the ‘mental script’ for complex problem-solving.
